          <p className="pb-5">Ropar, also known as Rupnagar, lying on the banks of the Sutlej, is one of the earliest inhabited 
          areas of the Punjab subcontinent, India. From the evidence found near the regions of the Indus Valley 
          civilization to the current administration that reigns supreme in the region, the district holds troves of history 
          to its name.<br></br><br></br>
            In the city, there are attractions of historical importance, such as:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li className="mt-3">There is an archaeological Museum in the city, indicating the existence of the Indus Valley civilization in the region.</li>
              <li className="mt-3">On the banks of river Sutlej lie the place where the treaty about Punjab’s future was signed between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and 
              the British East India Company, called Maharaja Ranjit Singh Park.</li>
              <li className="mt-3">Many Gurudwaras of historical importance are also in the city, and we mention Gurudwara Batha Sahib, the place visited 
              by the 10th Guru: Guru Gobind Singh. Another one is Gurudwara Tibbi Sahib.</li>
              <li className="mt-3">The city also nestles a 1.24–km–long bridge over the Sutlej River called the Sutlej River Bridge.</li>
              <li className="mt-3">Ropar Dam was established at the Sutlej River near the wetland area of Ropar. Ropar Wetland, also known as Ropar Lake, 
              is a man–made freshwater riverine and a biological diverse.</li>
            </ul><br></br>
            Not only is the city historically rich, but it also houses many industries, like the lock-making industry. Many historical towns nestle under the administration of the Ropar District, like Morinda, which falls on the way to the Mughal city of Sirhind, among many. The riches of city are best learned by exploring its horizons through history and evolution.
